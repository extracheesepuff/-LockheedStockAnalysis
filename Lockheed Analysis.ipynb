    "Our analysis concentrates on Lockheed's government contracts granted by the Department of Defense; how do these contracts impact Lockheed's stock prices? We also consider the influence of global aluminum prices on Lockheed's stock prices. Our goal is to synthesize information from the awarded contracts data, along with the commodity price trend, to offer explanations for changes in Lockheed's stock prices. In particular, we want to know if large government contracts affect an increase in stock prices to a larger extent. This provides insight into the impact of exogenous events and materials costs and the way in which they contribute to investor perceptions and subsequent valuations. Overall we wanted to look at multiple factors including contracts, commodities, geographic footprint, and contract timing to draw insights on what investors could potenially use when investing in Lockheed."

    "The insight drawn is a prediction of daily contract activity patterns based on the month of the year. Using a Decision Tree Regressor, we identified seasonal trends in when Lockheed Martin receives federal contracts. This is meaningful because it reveals procurement cycles and budget periods in government contracting. The highest prediction was for September, coinciding with the fiscal year-end, suggesting the government increases spending to use up their annual budget before it expires.\n",

This analysis shows contract distribution patterns and how government procurement timing might influence business operations and stock performance during peak contract months. This allows investors to know what months to pay attention to Lockheed the most.\n",

    "Insight: We wanted to look at how volatility in aluminum affected the volatility of the stock. Since we were able to quantify the monthly percentage change in both price metrics, we could measure whether swings in a raw material cost parallels with stock performance. This is meaningful, because aluminum is a key input used in aerospace manufacturing, which has a direct impact the production costs, and ultimately profit margin. For example the correlation coefficient indicates whether the two metrics move together (positive), move opposite (negatively), or move independently (near zero). We found that the coefficient was positive and weak making it not something to invest based on.\n",

    "New Learning: In order to conduct the analysis, we learned to align time-series data from various economic data sources to the same time period (monthly) and comment on percentage changes to measure volatility across different scales (comparing aluminum and Lockheed stocks). Moreover, we learned to use the Pearson correlation coefficient to quantify the relation of two variables and the strength of that relation. "

    "Insight:\n",
    "The insight we gained was a geographic breakdown of the distribution of Lockheed Martin's federal contracts over the top 19 states, by individual Lockheed's subsidiaries. We created a pivot table mapping each contract value against a lockheed entity within each state, which allowed us to see where defense spending is clustered as well as which divisions of the company operate out of each state. This is important, as it highlights their major operational locations as well as the economic implications of defense contracts on each state in the US. This means that states with higher contract values are also likely the location of larger production facilities or R&D functions, indicating Lockheed's strategic operational footprint. Our insight shows that Texas is Lockheed's biggest state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relation to Topic:\n",
    "Our topic was analyzing Lockheed Martin's federal contracts and share price performance. The analysis we performed is a direct examination of the geographic distribution of contracts, across the country, so we could see where the federal government is exhibiting spending in defense contracts. For example, if some big policy change happened in Texas for the aerospace industry, investors should most likely pay attention to their Lockheed investments because majority of their footprint is in Texas. \n",
    "\n",
    "New Learning:\n",
    "To perform the analysis we needed to learn how to perform pivot tables in pandas to change the way the data was organized from long-format to wide-format. We also learned how to do multi-dimensional grouping in one command to aggregate a pivot table by multiple categories (state and company) at one time. Finally, we learned how to sort a dataframe by first calculating temporary column totals (specifically rows) while maintaining detailed breakdown of the data."

By analyzing contracts above $500 million and examining stock returns over the 5 days after each award, we were able to observe how the federal government affects short-term stock market behavior.

    "### Visualization 1 Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight:\n",
    "The insight gained is the connection between changes in aluminum prices and changes in Lockheed's stock prices. By measuring the monthly percentage change in aluminum prices relative to Lockheed's stock, it is possible to observe whether and how changes in the price of a key input material affect stock performance. This is meaningful because aluminum is a critical input in aerospace manufacturing, and suppliers may increase their prices based on their own increased costs. Since aluminum is a key input, increases costs may reduce production margins, and ultimately investor sentiment. However, we found there is weak correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relation to Topic:\n",
    "Our topic was simply the measurement of Lockheed's stock, and this analysis shows a relationship between material costs and stock performance. This illustrates how external economic realities, such as commodity prices, could have an affect on the valuation of the company. Lastly, the analysis shows a slight positive correlation showing that investors should pay some attention to input costs for Lockheed.\n",
    "\n",
    "New Learning:\n",
    "To conduct this analysis, we learned how to calculate monthly percentage changes, filter and merge datasets into monthly periods, and create scatter plots with trend lines in Plotly. We also learned how to quantify the relationship between two different variables using a measure of correlation, which is important when analyzing dependencies in financial data. We also learned how to format the graph properly."

    "### Visualization 2 Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight: \n",
    "This visualization depicts the distribution of federal contracts awarded to Lockheed Martin subsidiaries by state. Aggregate contract amounts will be shown by state and recipient company (Lockheed subsidiaries) to show both where federal dollars are concentrated and which Lockheed divisions have a presence in each state. This is important because state policy, such as tax incentives or regulations, can determine where major contractors choose to operate. We decided to present only 14 states, as the remaining state contract values were insignificant and not readily seen in visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Relation to Topic: \n",
    "We were analyzing Lockheed's data both in terms of their federal contracts and the performance of their stock value. The visualization illustrates the geographic distribution of their contract awards, and illustrates the differentiated operations of Lockheed subsidiaries are strategically targeting states and state policy factors as they relate to allocating federal contract dollars. This can help investors know what state policies to pay attention to and what subsidaries have a bigger impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "New Learning: \n",
    "We learned how to create stacked bar charts in Plotly that display multiple dimensions simultaneously (state, company, and contract value). We learned how to filter, aggregate, and group our data by multiple grouping variable, and order categorical data by computed totals towards a more intuitive visualization."

    "### Visualization 3 Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight:\n",
    "The insight is a visual showing the effect of large federal contracts (greater than $500 million) on short-term stock returns. By plotting the 5-day return to contract size, and distinguishing between contracts that were associated with positive and negative outcomes, we are able to observe market patterns in response to federal spending on particular contracts.  This is significant since many investors are focused on identifying patterns linking government contracts and now know that large contracts actually cause more negative returns than positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relation to Topic:\n",
    "In our topic, we were interested in Lockheed’s stock and federal contracts, and the visualization demonstrates event-driven stock return performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "New Learning:\n",
    "In analyzing the data, we learned to code the color of data points based on whether the return was positive or negative and to show event-driven data in a plot using Plotly. We also learned how to align contract dates with stock market dates and a visual, and summarized it in the project."
